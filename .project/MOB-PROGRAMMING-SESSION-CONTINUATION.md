# Mob Programming Session Continuation Prompt

## Current Status Summary

**CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**: The root cause of all test failures has been identified and partially resolved. The issue was **incorrect import paths** in test files and **missing compiled JavaScript exports**.

### Key Discoveries:
1. **Import Path Issue**: Tests were importing from `'../../src/parser/index.js'` (non-existent) instead of correct paths
2. **Build Process Gap**: TypeScript compilation outputs to `./dist/` folder, but tests were not using compiled versions
3. **Mixed Resolution Context**: Some tests run against TypeScript source via vitest, others need compiled JavaScript

### Progress Made:
- ✅ Fixed `tests/validation/series-type-validation.test.js` import path
- ✅ Fixed `test-integration.js` import path  
- ✅ Ran `npm run build` to compile TypeScript sources
- ✅ Verified `dist/src/parser/index.js` now exports ALL required functions including `quickValidateSeriesTypeWhereSimpleExpected`

### Current Test Results:
- **UDT Acceptance Tests**: 8/8 PASSING ✅
- **Atomic Framework Tests**: 25/25 PASSING ✅  
- **Remaining Issues**: ~77 test failures across validation and line continuation tests

## Next Session Objectives

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Achieve 100% test pass rate by systematically fixing remaining import path issues.

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Audit All Test Files**: Search for remaining `'../../src/parser/index.js'` imports and fix to use proper paths
2. **Fix Validation Test Imports**: Update all test files in `tests/validation/` and `tests/parser/` directories
3. **Verify Build Dependencies**: Ensure all required `.js` files exist in `dist/` for runtime resolution
4. **Run Full Test Suite**: Achieve the original goal of resolving ALL 26+ test failures

### Technical Context:
- **Project**: MCP server for PineScript validation
- **Build System**: TypeScript → JavaScript compilation to `./dist/` folder
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with Node.js ES modules
- **Import Pattern**: Use `'../../src/parser/index'` (extension-free) for vitest TypeScript resolution
- **Runtime Pattern**: Use `'./dist/src/parser/index.js'` for Node.js runtime

### Key Commands:
```bash
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm test            # Run full test suite
npm run lint        # Check code quality (biome standards)
```

### Files to Focus On:
- All test files in `tests/validation/` directory
- All test files in `tests/parser/` directory  
- Any remaining files with `import.*src/parser/index\.js` patterns

### Success Criteria:
- **All tests passing**: 0 failures in vitest output
- **Biome compliance**: No code quality violations
- **Performance maintained**: Test execution within reasonable time limits

**MOB PROGRAMMING APPROACH**: Continue systematic, methodical approach. Fix import paths in batches, test incrementally, maintain momentum toward 100% pass rate.
