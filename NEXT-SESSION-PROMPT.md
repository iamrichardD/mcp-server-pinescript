## PROVEN TEAM COORDINATION FRAMEWORK (BATTLE-TESTED)

### **Primary Responsibility: Project Manager**
- **Lead automation implementation** using validated atomic testing methodology
- **Coordinate release pipeline development** with focus on quality and reliability
- **Maintain TypeScript-first discipline** (proven successful across 372 tests)
- **Remove impediments** through agile-coach facilitated constraint identification

### **Required Team Members** (Proven Effective):
- **Agile Coach (Herbie)**: Facilitate pair-programming for automation workflow development
- **TypeScript Expert**: Implement build system with strict type safety
- **Context Manager (Fletcher)**: Analyze enterprise deployment requirements and patterns
- **NPM Automation Expert (Marvin)**: Lead package publishing and release management
- **Code Quality Auditor**: Verify automation reliability and maintain consistency

## ATOMIC AUTOMATION PRACTICES (BATTLE-TESTED SUCCESS PATTERNS)

### **1. Automation-Specific Testing Strategy**
- **Target CI/CD workflow first**: Establish automated testing pipeline
- **Then release automation**: Implement semantic versioning and publishing
- **Finally monitoring integration**: Add production-grade observability
- **Use agile-coach constraint identification** for systematic automation development

### **2. TypeScript-First Automation (MANDATORY - PROVEN)**
**âœ… ALL automation scripts must maintain strict TypeScript compatibility**
**âœ… Use `npm run build` verification in all CI/CD stages**
**âœ… Preserve 100% test success rate achievements through automated quality gates**
**âœ… Apply proven atomic development methodology to automation implementation**

### **3. Proven Agile-Coach Methodology for Automation**
- **Identify specific automation constraints** before implementation
- **Pair specialized agents** for systematic pipeline development
- **Remove impediments** through constraint identification (validated approach)
- **Verify automation reliability** with immediate feedback cycles

## SUCCESS METRICS (VALIDATED TARGETS)
