## ⚠️ 2. What Didn't Go Well (Identify Challenges)

### **Project Manager Perspective**
*"Strategic challenges and coordination friction points"*

**Challenge Areas:**
- **Scope Creep Risk**: Biome integration revealed 64 errors + 244 warnings beyond initial assessment
- **Timeline Estimation**: Complex interdependencies between TypeScript migration and testing infrastructure
- **Resource Planning**: Underestimated effort required for comprehensive quality gate implementation

**Impact Assessment:**
- Initial "0 Biome violations" target proved unrealistic given codebase maturity
- Quality gate implementation became more complex than anticipated
- Agent coordination required more explicit communication protocols

### **TypeScript Expert Perspective**
*"Technical debt and migration complexity challenges"*

**Technical Obstacles:**
- **Legacy Code Complexity**: Existing JavaScript modules have significant technical debt
- **Type Definition Gaps**: Missing or incomplete type coverage for some parser components  
- **Build Configuration**: Biome and TypeScript configuration conflicts required manual resolution
- **Migration Dependencies**: Interconnected modules created migration sequencing challenges

**Concrete Examples:**
```
src/parser/validator.js: 21 errors, 33 warnings
src/parser/parameter-naming-validator.js: 1 error, 6 warnings  
```

### **Context Manager Perspective**
*"Documentation and requirement clarity gaps"*

**Information Challenges:**
- **Requirements Evolution**: Initial scope expanded as technical complexity revealed itself
- **Documentation Lag**: Real-time documentation struggled to keep pace with rapid implementation
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Some domain-specific Pine Script parsing rules lacked detailed documentation
- **Change Management**: Multiple simultaneous changes (Biome + TypeScript + Testing) created complexity

### **Agile Coach Perspective**
*"Process friction and impediment patterns"*

**Process Challenges:**
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Simultaneous changes across multiple technical domains
- **Quality Gate Conflicts**: Biome rules conflicted with existing coding patterns
- **Feedback Loop Delays**: TypeScript compilation errors required multiple iteration cycles
- **Team Coordination Overhead**: Agent specialization created handoff dependencies

**Systemic Issues:**
- Technical debt in existing codebase created resistance to quality improvements
- Lack of incremental deployment strategy for infrastructure changes
- Missing automated conflict resolution for tool configuration conflicts
