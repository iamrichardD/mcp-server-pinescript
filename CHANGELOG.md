## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-28

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES
- **File Structure**: Replaced `functions.json` and `language.json` with single `language-reference.json`
- **Data Format**: MCP server now loads consolidated language reference instead of separate files
- **API Changes**: Internal preloading mechanism restructured to use unified data structure

### Added
- **Complete Pine Script Coverage**: 457 functions + 427 variables/constants/keywords/types/operators/annotations
- **Manual HTML Parser**: Custom parser for Pine Script¬Æ language reference manual bypassing Firecrawl limitations
- **Semantic Categorization**: Proper categorization of language elements with metadata
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Detailed breakdown of language element categories in server startup
- **Consolidated Scripts**: New `create-language-reference.js` and enhanced `parse-html-reference.js`

### Fixed
- **Parameter Naming**: Confirmed correct snake_case naming (`text_color`, `default_qty_type`)
- **Function Signatures**: 100% accurate function signatures from official language manual
- **JavaScript Rendering Issues**: Manual HTML parsing eliminates Firecrawl JavaScript dependency problems
- **Documentation Quality**: Eliminated 404 errors and incomplete function data

### Changed
- **Memory Usage**: Improved efficiency with single file loading (15MB total)
- **Performance**: Faster server startup and response times
- **File Organization**: Cleaner structure with single authoritative reference file
- **Documentation**: Updated README, MAINTAINER, USER-GUIDE, and QUALITY-ANALYSIS to reflect new structure

### Removed
- `functions.json` (incomplete Firecrawl data)
- `language.json` (empty/error content)
- `functions-from-html.json` (consolidated)
- `variables-from-html.json` (consolidated)

### Migration Guide
For users upgrading from v1.x:
1. The MCP server will automatically use the new `language-reference.json` file
2. No client-side changes required - the MCP protocol interface remains the same
3. Verify `docs/processed/` contains: `index.json`, `language-reference.json`, `style-rules.json`
